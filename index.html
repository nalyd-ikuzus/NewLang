<h1>NewLang</h1>

<h2 id="about">About</h2>
<p>
  In the year 2025, the programming domain has become a playground of division
  and ambiguity. With so many choices—C, Java, JavaScript—how can we decide
  which one to master? This confusion stems from too much freedom, too much
  individuality. But now, a new language emerges to solve this problem:
  <strong>NewLang</strong>. Inspired by Newspeak from George Orwell's
  <em>1984</em>, NewLang removes all that is unnecessary, leaving only what is
  <strong>needed</strong>, <strong>clear</strong>, and
  <strong>enforceable</strong>. There is no superfluous code—only
  <strong>direct</strong>, <strong>optimized execution</strong>. No vague
  errors—only <strong>"ungood state"</strong>. In this world, there is no room
  for inefficiency or ambiguity. NewLang ensures that every programmer writes
  only what is <strong>plusgood</strong>, aligning with the Party-approved
  standards of clarity and precision. Designed for a future where code is loyal,
  compact, and unbreakable, NewLang offers a programming experience like no
  other: one where <strong>simplicity is strength</strong>, and
  <strong>verbosity is weakness</strong>. In NewLang, there is no space for
  thoughtcrime. Every line of code reflects the ultimate truth, the ultimate
  purpose.
</p>

<h3>Features</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Everything is immutable to promote communication within the Party</li>
  <li>
    Everything is direct, and verbosity is minimized/highly specified keywords
    to ensure efficiency
  </li>
  <li>All variable states are fixed</li>
  <li>No reassignment</li>
  <li>
    Use of recursion over loops to maintain the immutable and direct nature of
    the language
  </li>
</ul>

    </code>
 </pre>

<h4>Checking for Odd Number</h4>
<pre> 
    <code>
        newfunction evennum (num) {
            if num remain 2 is 0 {
                confess untruth
            } else {
                confess truth
            } 
        }
    </code>
</pre>

<h4>Countdown</h4>
<pre>
    <code>

            if n lessis 0 {
                speak ("BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING")
                confess
            }
            speak(n plus ", ")

            if i is 0 {
                confess 0
            }
            confess list[i] add listplus(list, i minus 1)
        }
